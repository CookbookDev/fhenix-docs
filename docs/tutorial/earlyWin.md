# Overview

In this short guide weâ€™ll encrypt plaintext to ciphertext using FHE, demonstrating how simple it is to enable confidentiality in your smart contracts with Fhenix.

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
    
    import "@fhenixprotocol/contracts/FHE.sol";
    
    contract EarlyWin {
      
       uint8 _plaintext;
       euint8 public _cipherText;
    
    
       function setCipherText(inEuint8 calldata _encryptedNumber) public  {
           // convert inEuint8 type structure to euint8
           _cipherText = FHE.asEuint8(_encryptedNumber);
       }
    
    
       function setPlainText(uint8 _number) public {
           //set standard plaintext
           _plaintext = _number;
       }
    
    
       function decrypt() public view returns (uint8) {
           return FHE.decrypt(_cipherText);
       }
    }

    ```

# Overview

First, FHE is imported directly into your contract with a single line of code. Next we establish two numbers or unsigned integers, withhowever the _cipherText number beingwill be encrypted. This means that it will not be publicly accessible from anyone other than the intended viewer. The standard _plaintext unit8 represents a number that is public for all to view. On line 11 we have a setter function that allows us to pass in a new encrypted number that will stay private. On line 21 we have a decrypt function that allows us to view the number that was written to state in the setCipherText function. As you can see there is no requirement for off-chain proof generation or storage. 

    ```solidity
    import "@fhenixprotocol/contracts/FHE.sol";
    ```
We are able to import the FHE precompiles directly into the smart contract with a single line of code. The power of FHE in one single line of copy pasta. 

    ```solidity
    function getSensitiveData(Permission calldata perm) public view onlySender(perm) returns (string memory) {
        // Logic to return sensitive data
    }
    ```

    ```solidity
    function getSensitiveData(Permission calldata perm) public view onlySender(perm) returns (string memory) {
        // Logic to return sensitive data
    }
    ```
