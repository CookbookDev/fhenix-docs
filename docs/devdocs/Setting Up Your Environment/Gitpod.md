# Gitpod

If you're more of a cloud-based developer, you can skip all the installation steps and work directly with our Gitpod environment. This environment includes a LocalFhenix instance and all the tools you need to dive in.

You can run an instance of LocalFhenix in Gitpod by [clicking here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fhenixprotocol/hardhat-template) (or directly from the hardhat-template repo)
