# eAddress

_A representation of an encrypted address using Fully Homomorphic Encryption.
It consists of 5 encrypted 32-bit unsigned integers (`euint32`)._

```solidity
struct Eaddress {
  euint32[5] values;
}
```

## ConfAddress

### toEaddress

```solidity
function toEaddress(address addr) internal pure returns (struct Eaddress)
```

Encrypts a plaintext Ethereum address into its encrypted representation (`eaddress`).

_Iterates over 5 chunks of the address, applying a bitmask to each, then encrypting with `FHE`._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| addr | address | The plain Ethereum address to encrypt |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | struct Eaddress | eaddr The encrypted representation of the address |

### unsafeToAddress

```solidity
function unsafeToAddress(struct Eaddress eaddr) internal pure returns (address)
```

Decrypts an `eaddress` to retrieve the original plaintext Ethereum address.

_This operation should be used with caution as it exposes the encrypted address._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| eaddr | struct Eaddress | The encrypted address to decrypt |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | address | The decrypted plaintext Ethereum address |

### resestEaddress

```solidity
function resestEaddress(struct Eaddress eaddr, euint32 ezero) internal pure
```

Re-encrypts the encrypted values within an `eaddress`.

_The re-encryption is done to change the encrypted representation without
altering the underlying plaintext address, which can be useful for obfuscation purposes in storage._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| eaddr | struct Eaddress | The encrypted address to re-encrypt |
| ezero | euint32 | An encrypted zero value that triggers the re-encryption |

### equals

```solidity
function equals(struct Eaddress lhs, address payable addr) internal view returns (ebool)
```

Determines if an encrypted address is equal to a given plaintext Ethereum address.

_This operation encrypts the plaintext address and compares the encrypted representations._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| lhs | struct Eaddress | The encrypted address to compare |
| addr | address payable | The plaintext Ethereum address to compare against |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | ebool | res A boolean indicating if the encrypted and plaintext addresses are equal |

### conditionalUpdate

```solidity
function conditionalUpdate(ebool condition, struct Eaddress eaddr, struct Eaddress newEaddr) internal pure returns (struct Eaddress)
```
