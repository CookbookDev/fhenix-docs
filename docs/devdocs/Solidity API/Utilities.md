# Utility Contracts

## Encrypted Address

Encrypting an address is not an easy task as we currently only support encrypted uint32s (4 bytes) and address are formed out of 20 bytes.
We created a tool that implements `Eaddress` which is formed by 5 uint32s.
This utility allows you to do some operations on encrypted addresses.
The tool can be imported from: TBD
An example of how to use the tool can be found it: TBD
