# ✨ Fhenix & FHE

Fhenix is revolutionizing the blockchain space by utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption for confidential smart contracts on public blockchains. One of the most pressing challenges in the blockchain space is ensuring privacy, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents a promising solution. By leveraging FHE's ability to process encrypted data, we can effectively address privacy concerns, creating a safer environment for Web3 applications.

## FHE - Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Fully Homomorphic Encryption — or FHE for short — is a technology that enables processing data without decrypting it. This means companies can offer their services without ever seeing their users’ data — and users will never notice a difference in functionality.

With data encrypted both in transit and during processing, everything we do online could now be encrypted end-to-end, not just sending messages!

FHE makes it possible to write private smart contracts to keep on-chain data encrypted. You can create decentralized, permissionless blockchains where everything is on-chain and auditable while not actually visible.

## Fhenix Frontier

Fhenix Frontier is the first public iteration of the Fhenix protocol. It is an early build, one that has a lot of bugs and missing features.

There are many challenges we still need to face, and many problems to solve. But we are excited to be working on this project, and we are excited to have you join us on this journey.

In no way is anything we write here set in stone. We are still figuring out what the best way to do things is, and we are still figuring out what the best way to do and explain things is.
If you have any suggestions, ideas or feedback, please let us know. We are always looking for ways to improve and for people to contribute.
