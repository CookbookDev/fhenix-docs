title: üîê Encryption Schema
---

In this section we will describe the encryption schema used in Fhenix. While the network itself is Schema agnostic - i.e. it can support any encryption schema - the current default schema is TFHE.

## FHE over the Torus (TFHE)

FHE over the Torus (TFHE) represents an advanced FHE method that offers notable improvements over traditional FHE technologies.

Blockchains basically deal with integer operations, whether handling large volumes of cryptocurrency transactions, managing smart contract states, or updating block indices. All these essential operations are based on integers. TFHE's efficient processing of computations is performed on integers in their encrypted form and thus provides significant added value.

Furthermore, most blockchains operate on a consensus mechanism that involves numerous complex integer-based computations. TFHE's ability to handle these operations quickly and efficiently increases overall blockchain performance and reduces computational bottlenecks. The benefit of this efficiency becomes even more crucial as blockchains scale, resulting in increased transaction volume and smart contract complexity.

TFHE offers an excellent, viable encryption solution for maintaining privacy and optimizing performance of blockchain technologies.
