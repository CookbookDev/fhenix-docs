As part of the hackathon we are providing a multitude of tools to develop FHE-powered smart contracts, the highlight of which is the Devnet environment, which is a public network that supported encrypted smart contracts!&#x20;

Use the links below to learn how to connect to the Devnet, how to set up your development environment and take your first steps with FHE!&#x20;
