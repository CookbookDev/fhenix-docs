# ðŸŽ‰ Fhenix & (T)FHE

Fhenix is revolutionizing the blockchain space by utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption for confidential smart contracts on public blockchains. One of the most pressing challenges in the blockchain space is ensuring privacy, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents a promising solution. By leveraging FHE's ability to process encrypted data, we can effectively address privacy concerns, creating a safer environment for Web3 applications.

## FHE - Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Fully Homomorphic Encryption â€” or FHE for short â€” is a technology that enables processing data without decrypting it. This means companies can offer their services without ever seeing their usersâ€™ data â€” and users will never notice a difference in functionality.

With data encrypted both in transit and during processing, everything we do online could now be encrypted end-to-end, not just sending messages!

FHE makes it possible to write private smart contracts to keep on-chain data encrypted. You can create decentralized, permissionless blockchains where everything is on-chain and auditable while not actually visible.

## TFHE - FHE over the Torus

Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) represents an advanced method of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) that offers notable improvements over traditional FHE technologies.&#x20;

Blockchains, at their core, primarily deal with integer operationsâ€”whether it's for handling the quantities of cryptocurrency transactions, managing smart contract states, or updating block indices. All these essential operations are based on integers. Therefore, the fact that TFHE can efficiently process computations on integers in their encrypted form is tremendously valuable.

Additionally, most blockchains operate on a consensus mechanism that involves numerous complex integer-based computations. TFHE's ability to handle these operations quickly and efficiently can significantly increase the blockchain's overall performance, reducing computational bottlenecks. This efficiency becomes crucial as blockchains scale and the volume of transactions and complexity of smart contracts increase. As a result, TFHE is not just a viable, but an ideal, encryption solution for maintaining privacy and optimizing performance in blockchain technologies.
