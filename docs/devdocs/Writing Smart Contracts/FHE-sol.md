# üê§ Getting Started

A core component of the Fhenix ecosystem is the FHE.sol solidity library. It serves as the bridge from the public to the private EVM.
It is a Solidity library that provides a set of functions that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data.

To find a full list of functions and their descriptions, please refer to the [FHE.sol documentation](../Solidity%20API/FHE.md).

## Installation

To get started with FHE.sol, you need to install it as a dependency in your Solidity project. You can do this using npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory, then run the following:

```bash
npm install @fhenixprotocol/contracts;
```

Or

```bash
yarn install @fhenixprotocol/contracts;
```

## Usage

### Operations Example
For operation examples please refer to [FHE.sol operation testers](https://github.com/FhenixProtocol/fheos/tree/master/solidity/tests/contracts)
