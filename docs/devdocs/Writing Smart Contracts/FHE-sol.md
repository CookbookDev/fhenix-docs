# Writing Smart Contracts

A core component of the Fhenix ecosystem is the FHE.sol solidity library. It serves as the bridge from the public to the private EVM. 
It is a Solidity library that provides a set of functions that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. 

To find a full list of functions and their descriptions, please refer to the [FHE.sol documentation](https://docs.fhenix.io/developer-guides/fhe-by-example/fhe-sol).

## Installation

To get started with FHE.sol, you need to install it as a dependency in your Solidity project. You can do this using npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory, then run the following:

```Javascript
import {FHE} from "@fhenixprotocol/contracts/FHE.sol";
```
