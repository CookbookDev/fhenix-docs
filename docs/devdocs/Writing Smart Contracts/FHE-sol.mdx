# üê§ Getting Started

A core component of the Fhenix ecosystem is the `FHE.sol` Solidity library.

`FHE.sol` is a Solidity library designed to facilitate the use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) within Ethereum smart contracts. FHE enables computations to be performed on encrypted data (ciphertexts) without needing to decrypt them first. The results of such computations, when decrypted, are identical to what would have been obtained if the operations had been performed on the unencrypted data (plaintexts).

A full list and description of Fhenix functions is provided in [FHE.sol documentation](../Solidity%20API/FHE.md).

## Installation

To get started with `FHE.sol`, first install FHE.sol as a dependency in your Solidity project. Do this using npm, yarn or pnpm. Open the terminal and navigate to the project's directory. Now, run one of the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
```bash
npm install @fhenixprotocol/contracts;
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
```bash
yarn install @fhenixprotocol/contracts;
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm install @fhenixprotocol/contracts;
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

### Key Concepts and Types

### `euintxx` - Encrypted Unsigned Integers
- **Description**: Represents an encrypted unsigned integer. This type is used for encrypted variables within smart contracts.
The currently supported types are: `euint8`, `euint16`, `euint32`, `euint64`, `euint128` & `euint256`.
- **Usage**: Stores and manipulates encrypted values within smart contracts.

### `inEuintxx` - Input Encrypted Unsigned Integers
- **Description**: A type used for passing encrypted values as function arguments. It's the format in which encrypted data is input into the smart contract functions that process encrypted values.
The currently supported types are `inEuint8`, `inEuint16`, `inEuint32`, `inEuint64`, `inEuint128`, `inEuint256`.
- **Usage**: Passes typed encrypted values as function arguments.

### `ebool` - Encrypted Unsigned Integers
- **Description**: Represents an encrypted Boolean value. This type is used for encrypted variables within smart contracts
The name of the type is `ebool`.
- **Usage**: Stores and manipulates encrypted Boolean values within smart contracts.

## Core Functions of FHE.sol

### `asEuint` - Convert to Encrypted Unsigned Integer
- **Purpose**: Converts a plaintext number or an `inEuint` encrypted input into an `euint` type.

### `decrypt` - Decrypt Encrypted Data
- **Purpose**: Decrypts an `euint` encrypted value back to its plaintext form. If the value should only be revealed to a specific address, the `sealoutput` function should be used instead. Learn more abut sealing [here](../Returning-Data.md).

### Arithmetic Operations
FHE.sol supports encrypted arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. These operations can be performed directly on `euint` types, enabling encrypted computations.

### Comparison Operations
- **Purpose**: Perform comparisons between encrypted values (e.g., greater than, less than).
- **Usage Example**: Make decisions based on encrypted values without revealing their contents.

## Example Use Cases

### Encrypting a Value
To encrypt a value, convert a plaintext `uint32` into an `euint32`:

```solidity
uint32 plaintextValue = 123;
euint32 encryptedValue = FHE.asEuint32(plaintextValue);
```

### Decrypting a Value
To decrypt an encrypted value back to plaintext, use the following syntax:

```solidity
uint32 decryptedValue = FHE.decrypt(encryptedValue);
```

:::warning
Decrypt data with caution. Be careful not to expose decrypted data to unauthorized parties.
:::

### Performing Encrypted Arithmetic
You can perform arithmetic operations directly on encrypted values. For example, adding two encrypted values:

```solidity
euint32 sum = encryptedValue1 + encryptedValue2;
```

### Conditional Logic with Encrypted Values

Use a comparison operation to implement logic based on encrypted values. Consider the following code:

```solidity
euint32 result = FHE.select(encryptedValue1.gt(encryptedValue2), encryptedValue1, encryptedValue2);
```

This example chooses between encryptedValue1 and encryptedValue2 by comparing their encrypted values with the `gt` function.

## Integrating FHE into Smart Contracts

When incorporating `FHE.sol` into your smart contracts, consider the following:

- **Privacy vs. Gas Cost**: FHE provides strong privacy guarantees but is computationally intensive and can lead to high gas costs. Balance the need for privacy with its cost.
- **Data Types**: Ensure that your use cases are compatible with the data types and operations supported by FHE.sol.
- **Security**: Understand the security model of FHE and how it fits into the overall security posture of your application.
